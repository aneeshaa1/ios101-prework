## App Brainstorming 

### Features I appreciate from existing apps:

Apple's Photos App:
 - search the camera roll using key words, dates, locations, etc.
 - create custom albums
 - zoom in and out of the camera roll as well as individual photos and videos

YouTube
 - recommends suggested videos
 - adjust playback speed of video

Spotify
 - the song that is playing show's on the device's lockscreen
 - add songs to queue
 - create and share playlists
